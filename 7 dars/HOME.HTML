        Globalization and Information Management Strategy <br><br>
Jatinder N.D. Gupta, Sushil K. Sharma, in Encyclopedia of Information Systems, 2003<br><br>

II.E. Changing Technology
Advancements in information and communication technologies, the Internet, and other Web technologies have provided many opportunities for the most dramatic economic turnaround in modern times. The Internet is helping to globally expand markets at a low cost. Its facility to communicate information instantaneously across the globe has provided the opportunity for consumers to readily find and compare information about products, services, and prices in a global market. Today, information is transferred so easily across the globe that products and processes can quickly be copied or imitated. The continuous rapid development and innovation have shortened the product life cycle to reinforce competitive pressure and the need to invest more in innovation.<br><br>

The information technology (IT) revolution has brought many changes in the organizational environment. As the organizations use more technology, they can expand their operations and activities to a global domain. Traditional barriers of international trade are breaking down and new global markets are emerging. Since organizations are competing on global terms, globalization can greatly complicate the task of managing IT in a firm. The IT has demonstrated an ability to change or create the following:<br><br>

•
New business models<br>

•
New products and services<br>

•
New workflows and procedures<br>

•
New relationships with customers and suppliers<br>

•
New partnerships and alliances Increased span of control<br>
•
New form of organizations—“Virtual Organizations”<br>

IT has the potential to create market driven organizations. Flexibility and rapid response are key to success in the new Internet-driven economy for both businesses and customers. The increasing pace of change in market conditions places a premium on building flexible organizations in the business world. Market driven organizations are those organizations which can respond to the new business environment and that have a fluid and flexible internal structure which can respond quickly to changed circumstances. Organizations should focus on their core competences, shedding distracting side businesses and internal production capabilities that could be better performed by outside providers. The priority of market driven organizations should be customers, their preferences, and long-term relationships.<br>
